Benefits:
- Custom kernel optimization
- Handles billions of users daily
- Reliability under heavy load

4. NASA
Why: NASA uses Linux for everything from space operations to research simulations.
Benefits:
- Stability in mission-critical systems
- Control in scientific computing
- Robust automation and scripting support

5. Netflix
Why: Netflix streams millions of videos daily using FreeBSD and Linux-based servers.
Benefits:
